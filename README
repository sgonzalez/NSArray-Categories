A few UIImage categories for creating thumbnails from a UIImage, cropping an image, rounding an image's corners, and doing stuff with alpha.

This may be super useful for adding images in UITableViewCells or some kind of cover flow view.

Usage.m is a file showing the usage of this category, this is NOT a proper category implementation.

There is no attribution required but is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for downloading,
Santiago
